# Learning Scala

This is how you sum two integers in Scala:

```tut
1 + 1
```

This is a Scala code block:

```scala
val x = List(1, 2, 3)
```

Inline code example (no inline syntax highlighting out-of-the-box for gfm):
`println("Hello, World!)`.

## Some math using MathJax

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
